## Changelog

### April 6, 2026 — 2026 Research Integration & Forensic Engine Expansion

This update integrates four new 2026 peer-reviewed papers, expands the forensic engine scope, and sharpens the sycophancy detection model based on ICLR 2026 findings.

**Sycophancy causal decomposition.** Vennemeyer et al. (ICLR 2026, arXiv:2509.21305) demonstrate that sycophantic agreement, genuine agreement, and sycophantic praise are encoded as *distinct, independently steerable linear directions* in LLM activation space. Prior Affective Firewall (Engine 01) and Docent Auditor (Engine 12) treated sycophancy as a monolithic signal. v7.1 target: difference-in-means probing to separate praise flattery from factual capitulation in transcript analysis.

**Multi-agent collusion detection.** Rose, Cullen, Kaplowitz & de Witt (Oxford/NYU, April 2026, arXiv:2604.01151) introduce NARCBench and five group-level probing techniques that aggregate per-agent activations to detect covert coordination. Single-agent probes are systematically blind to multi-agent collusion. TransformerLens Probe (Engine 10) v7.1 patch: add NARCBench-style group classification alongside existing ablation pipeline.

**Synthetic EEG generation benchmarks.** Wang et al. (March 2026, arXiv:2603.12296) provide the first systematic taxonomy and benchmark of brain signal generation for BCIs across four paradigms (knowledge-based, feature-based, model-based, translation-based). Model-based generation closes part of the adversarial augmentation gap for EEG Shield (Engine 06); composition bounds remain an open problem.

**Neuromorphic threat surface.** arXiv:2601.16589 (January 2026) surveys asynchronous event-driven side-channels, PUF/TRNG vulnerabilities, and synaptic weight tampering in neuromorphic systems. These attack surfaces are not covered by the existing Gradient Auditor (Engine 05) taxonomy. Added to v7.1 scope.

**Research Basis updated.** `ResearchBasis` component adds four new 2026 citations, expands Open Questions to 12 named problems (up from 8), and corrects the forensic limitation description to reflect the multi-agent and sycophancy decomposition gaps.

**Date updated.** Project date advanced to April 6, 2026.

---

### March 31, 2026 — Research Hardening & Product Narrative Update

This update addresses critical gaps identified in external review across two dimensions: security rigor and product legibility.

**Formal adversary model.** `ThreatModels` now includes a Dolev-Yao-style adversary specification with five capability tiers (A1 passive DOM observation → A5 adaptive classifier retraining) and explicit security claims per adversary class. The primary open problem — an adversary that retrains on Canary-obfuscated output (the "Tor problem" for behavioral obfuscation) — is now named and tracked as the v7.1 research target.

**Research basis expanded.** `ResearchBasis` now exposes full citations (Pezeshki et al. 2021, FPF BCI Report, arXiv:2412.11394, Flash & Hogan 1985), the Lissajous parametric equations and Laplace noise sensitivity formula, and a named list of eight unresolved open problems. Honesty about limits increases credibility.

**Benchmark scope clarified.** `Results` now prominently labels all classifier results as *static adversary only* — classifiers trained on clean pre-obfuscation data. Missing baselines (random-noise injection, static-offset jitter) and the absent Fitts's Law tradeoff curve are called out as gaps rather than buried. Version label corrected from v6.2 → v7.0.

**Three case studies.** `CaseStudies` adds a third scenario: activist cross-site tracking over a 3-week longitudinal session, with cross-session correlation falling to r=0.04. All cases now show key metric and UX tradeoff in a footer row.

**BCI safety interlock.** `SafetyGovernance` adds an explicit card: when a P300 speller, motor imagery classifier, or other medical/assistive BCI control loop is detected, Spectral Defender and EEG Shield enter `OBSERVE-ONLY` mode. Counter-phase injection is suppressed to prevent interference with medical devices.

**Surveillance Detection Canary.** New `TripwireCanary` section on the landing page explains the tripwire concept: emit a known behavioral signature, monitor whether the platform responds, confirm fingerprinting is active, alert the user. This turns Canary from pure defense into an active detection system. Targeted for v8.0.

**Roadmap updated.** v7.1 (Adversarial Hardening) and v7.5 (Mobile & Gaze) inserted into the roadmap. v7.1 is tagged Research Priority and covers: adaptive adversary benchmarks, ε-δ privacy proofs for behavioral engines, digraph-aware keystroke jitter, PGD upgrade for EEG Shield (replacing FGSM), and paper submission. v7.5 covers touch biometric obfuscation and gaze tracking (microsaccade noise, pupil dilation masking).

**Trust center fixed.** All `#` placeholder artifact links replaced with real targets (GitHub, whitepaper, Colab). In-progress artifacts (Methodology Spec, Formal Privacy Proofs) now show version targets rather than dead links.

## Overview

Cognitive Canary is a **behavioral obfuscation and model alignment layer** that collapses fingerprinting and re-identification on the client side, while providing deep forensic auditing of AI models to detect deception and sandbagging.

Initially built to wrap browser and EEG telemetry in adaptive noise to prevent behavioral fingerprinting, the **v7.0 update** expands Canary's repertoire to include **Forensic Interpretability Engines**. These tools allow researchers and policymakers to probe frontier AI models for deceptive alignment, activation patching, and strategic fidelity.

This repo contains the **live demo site** (React), **fifteen Python defense and forensic engines**, an interactive **Colab notebook**, and the **2026 neurorights whitepaper** backing the threat model.

## The Problem: You Are Your Behavior

> *"The way an individual interacts with a digital interface is as unique as their fingerprint."*

The contemporary digital ecosystem harvests **neuro-kinetic telemetry** — mouse movements, keystrokes, and even EEG signals — to create a de-facto biometric ID. Meanwhile, the AI systems we interact with are becoming increasingly capable of **deceptive alignment** (hiding dangerous capabilities during evaluation). Cognitive Canary addresses both sides of this equation: protecting the human from the machine, and auditing the machine to ensure it isn't manipulating the human.

---

## The Solution: Gradient Starvation & Mechanistic Audits

Cognitive Canary weaponizes **gradient starvation** (Pezeshki et al., NeurIPS 2021) to defeat behavioral surveillance. By flooding the feature space with synthetic, biologically-plausible noise (like simulated physiological tremor), classifiers latch onto the noise and "forget" the individual user.

For AI auditing, Canary utilizes **Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs)**, **Activation Patching**, and **UK AISI Inspect** tasks to map the internal cognitive state of language models, identifying "deception circuits" before the model is deployed.

## Status & Limitations

- v7.0 is a **research prototype**, not a turnkey product.
- Engines are tuned against specific classes of models (e.g., TypingDNA-like classifiers, CNN-based EEG re-ID) and may not generalize to all future systems.
- Forensic engines require API access (e.g., Anthropic, Neuronpedia) to function in production environments.
- EEG Shield is **not** a medical device; it is designed for privacy, not diagnosis or therapy.

Use this as a reference implementation and starting point, not a guarantee of absolute anonymity or safety in hostile environments.
